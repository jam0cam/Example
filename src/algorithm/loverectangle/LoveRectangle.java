/**
 *
 * A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles
 * as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane. They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users'
 * love rectangles. They suspect finding that intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause
 * an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.
 *
 * Two rectangles overlapping a little. It must be love.
 * Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.
 *
 * As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously:
 * each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.
 *
 * Your output rectangle should be a Rectangle object as well.
